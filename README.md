# Mandelbrot
Plots the mandelbrot set in your terminal.

Heavily inspired by [this](github.com/rust-in-action/code/blob/1st-edition/ch2/ch2-mandelbrot) exercise/demo from **Rust in Action** by Tim McNamara.

I modified the original example to understand working with TUIs a bit better.

This version will dynamically resize with the terminal window, and will quit when the user presses 'q'
